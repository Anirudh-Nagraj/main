I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. For without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we are dealing with a niche audience, getting people for interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday.  </span></p>
