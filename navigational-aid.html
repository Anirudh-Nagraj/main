				<h3><b>What's this about?</b></h3>
				<p class=" justified paragraph">
					<b class="textbackground3"> An industry funded study to assess the manner in which blind users interact with technology while running. </b>  The end goal of the study was to develop a prototype that aids them with the detection of obstacles while on the run.

				</p>
			</p>

			<h3 class ="uppermargin"><strong>My Role </strong></h3>
			<p class="justified paragraph">  This project was done in collaboration with <b class="textbackground3">TOYOTA.</b> This was a two year project. It included an overall team of 5 people, cutting across diversities, comprising of Designers, HCI Researchers, and a Faculty as the chief investigator. <b class="textbackground3">As the lead user researcher</b>, I successfully helped build the prototype to aid blind runners leading the student team in research related activities.</p>

		<h3 class="uppermargin"><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
		<p class="justified paragraph"> As a team, we prioritized user research and narrowed down on the type of device that can fit the users' needs.</p>
		<p class="justified paragraph"> We chose 3 different sensors (Infrared, Ultrasonic, and LIDAR) to incorporate into the device, and from the research material gathered,<b class="textbackground3"> we decided to go with a RUNNING BELT - The TRIDENT. </b> </p>


			<img src="assets/img/Personal/prototype_color.png" class="avatar9 uppermargin" alt="">

		<p class="justified paragraph"><b>TRIDENT</b> stands for Tri-Positional Detection and Navigational Technology. The key features of the system include enhanced awareness of surroundings, detection of obstacles above and below the waist, modes for long and short range detection and choice of output. These features have been determined from interviews conducted with blind joggers and runners. </p></p>




<h3 class ="uppermargin"><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>
<ul><li class="justified paragraph">  Study was challenging because of the dearth of existing literature about projects and devices used in this space. </li>
<li class="justified paragraph"> Testing with real users was a problem given pandemic protocols.</li>
<li class="justified paragraph"> As the user base was niche, recruitment of participants was a hard and long process.</li>
<li class="justified paragraph">
	Asynchronous coordination during prototype building extended the time frame of development.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="container">
	<h3 class ="uppermargin"><strong>Research Gap</strong></h3>
	<ul>
		<li class="justified paragraph">While there is a lot of buzz in the market related to accessibility related products with respect to individuals who are blind, there is hardly any device that pops up when specific to running</span></li>
		<li class="justified paragraph">There is not enough documented evidence to suggest that the existing research aids blind runners.</span></li>
		<li class="justified paragraph">Efficiency of many prototypes yet to be tested in real world environments.</span> </li>
		<li class="justified paragraph">It is still unknown whether users would be able to connect and run the setup successfully should there be a reassembly or a first time assembly. </span></li>

			<li>
				Literature Reviews

			</li>
			<li>

			<p>
				To populate the insights and draw major themes arising from the research and the profiling, we decided to create an affinity map. This exercise allowed us to directly focus on the key aspects of the research and what users want, giving the prototype building a direction to focus on. Parallely, the team also conducted bodystorming, and created storyboards to understand the situational aspects of the device in terms of the feasibility, and working.

						The team gained valuable actionable insights from the user research conducted.

					<ul>
						<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">Multiple obstacle detection: </b>  Array of obstacles to be detected and not just a single obstacle.</p>
						<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">A non-intrusive device that is multimodal: </b> The device should not hinder them in any way either physically or mentally while running</li>
						<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">Presentation of multiple haptic feedback: </b> Receiving an array of feedback in the form of haptics while approaching an obstacle.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">Detection of obstacles: </b> Learning about the obstacle from a short distance away.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">Terrain: </b>The device should work in multiple terrains, and not just track and field.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							<b class="textbackground3">Tether: </b>Runners who use the tether, screen the area before the run so that they have a plan and a map in mind.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							<b class="textbackground3">Height: </b>While on a trail, the difference in heights can lead to a scenario where the blind runner gets hit by a tree branch while the sighted guide just ducks underneath –</b>
						</p>
							<p class="paragraph"><b class="textbackground3">THE RUNNING BELT - </b> People liked the prospect of a belt to aid them while they are running as they have never tried it before.  Although they did not appear to care too much about it, the idea of customization was welcomed.

							<h3 class="uppermargin"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
							<p class="justified paragraph">This <b class="textbackground3">low cost device </b>consists of a variety of sensors to offer a wider detection range. </p>
							<p class="justified paragraph">The output works on haptics and can be used by Deaf and Hard of hearing people as well.</p>

							<p class="justified paragraph">The users do not have to spend money on devices that are expensive and bear only one sensor as this <b class="textbackground3"> prototype is a handy alternative </b>. </p>

							<p class="justified paragraph">We anticipate that people in Low-and Middle income countries would be able to afford the device should it hit the market. </p>

						<p class="justified paragraph">This device can be used for <b class="textbackground3"> regular walking as well, extending from the runners </b>. </p>

						<p class="justified paragraph">	We have made this belt <b class="textbackground3"> non-intrusive </b> as possible. Majority of the users feel that the belt is lightweight and can be used as an alternative to the devices currently available.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="container">
									<h3 class="uppermargin"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3>
									<p class="justified paragraph">We would like to try the prototpe on users who are blind to understand what they think about it for daily wear and tear. In addition to that, we would like to go one step further in adding a camera to detect obstacles on its path and notifying the users, a field where there is a lot of research going on. Last, we would like to test the prototype in different terrains, which is currently impeaded due to the ongoing Global Pandemic, the COVID-19.</p>


						<h3 class="uppermargin"><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
						<p class="justified paragraph bottompadding">
							From start to finish, this project has been a learning curve. I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. For without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we dealt with a niche audience, recruitment for context interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday. I hope to take this research into the industry where I can work to develop products beneficial for people, one product at a time.
