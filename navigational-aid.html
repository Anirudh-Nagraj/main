		  As a research assistant at the university, I worked on this project to develop a prototype for runners who are blind. This was done in collaboration with another university and a large automobile manufacturer as part of the <b>Mobility for All</b> project. Currently, we are evaluating the prototype created.</p>

			<h3> About the Prototype</h3>
            <p class="justified">
              <b>TRIDENT</b> stands for Tri-Positional Detection and Navigational Technology. The key features of the system include enhanced awareness of surroundings, detection of obstacles above and below the waist, modes for long and short range detection and choice of output. These features have been determined from interviews conducted with blind joggers and runners.
            </p>
          </div>
		  <div class="container content">
		  <h3>My Role</h3>
		  <p class="justified text-aria"> As the main user researcher and one of two people who built the device, I successfully built a prototype using the insights and data I collected from generative research conducted initially.  </p>
		  <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p class="justified text-aria">
              Dealing with a niche audience made us go beyond the normal research and look in depth for solutions more than one. The end goal? Building an effective and efficient prototype that the users can wear while running. Qualitative research enabled us to look at the major pain-points, build a user-friendly device that enables the runner to avoid obstacles in their path.

Often, they find it hard to concentrate on the path because of the obstacles. To alleviate some of these standing problems, our team at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County decided to build a device for blind runners through the <span class="irqhighlight"> user centered approach </span>.

I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. For without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we are dealing with a niche audience, getting people for interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday. </span></p>
