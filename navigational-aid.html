				As a part of the Toyota Mobility Challenge, the project was a <b>study to assess the manner in which blind users interact with technology while running and develop a prototype, to aid them with the running.</b> The prototype was named TRIDENT, and was built from the insights obtained from research done from user interviews, and field studies. Analysis of existing applications and reviews were conducted to better understand how users react with respect to wearables in general.
			</p>

			<h5 class="uppermargin textbackground"><b>WHAT IS TRIDENT?</b></h5>
			<p class="justified"><b>TRIDENT</b> stands for Tri-Positional Detection and Navigational Technology. The key features of the system include enhanced awareness of surroundings, detection of obstacles above and below the waist, modes for long and short range detection and choice of output. These features have been determined from interviews conducted with blind joggers and runners. </p>

	<p class="justified portfolio-padding">This <b>low cost device </b>consists of a variety of sensors to offer a wider detection range. The output works on haptics and can be used by Deaf and Hard of hearing people as well. The users do not have to spend money on devices that are expensive and bear only one sensor as this <b> prototype is a handy alternative </b>.  We anticipate that people in Low-and Middle income countries would be able to afford the device should it hit the market. This device can be used for <b> regular walking as well, extending from the runners </b>. All users liked the idea of a non-intrusive belt that can be used to detect obstacles. We have made this belt as <b> non-intrusive </b> as possible. Majority of the users feel that the belt is lightweight and can be used as an alternative to the devices currently available.</span></p>

																Having understood the competitive landscape, research projects, and the behavior of users while on the run, we were <b>ready to profile the users, build empathy and solidify the information</b> we had at our disposal.

															<h4 class="textbackground"><b>BodyStorming</b></h4>

																		Bodystorming was done to get an idea on the possible scenarios with the prototype to be designed. Equipment like a helmet, wires for pathing were used to demonstrate how the potential user may feel/think/act in a given scenario. Bodystorming sessions were also done to generate empathy for runners who are blind.

																			<li class="text-aria justified">One thing about body storming is that researchers must be aware of the sensitivity of the topic under consideration without which the bodystorming session can go completely wrong.  </li>

Scenarios also made us understand the key features of our device, where it may be used and also shed some light on the environmental condition that may hamper it's usage. We created scenarios because we believed that it would help us in understanding environmental specific motivational factors and guide user thought process.

											To populate the insights and draw major themes arising from the research and the profiling, we decided to create an affinity map. This exercise allowed us to directly focus on the key aspects of the research and what users want. Parallely, the team also started coding the data for the interviews conducted to populate the insights and base the design accordingly.
											<h5 class="uppermargin textbackground"><b>Affinity Map</b></h5>
											<p class ="justified"><span class = "text-aria"> We created the affinity diagram exercise to populate the themes, arrange thoughts from brainstorming into clusters and note what was important to the development of the prototype. Once we had all the data points ready, the team sat down and created an affinity diagram to draw themes and prioritize them. Collaboration was done on an online tool called <span class ="irqhighlight"><b>MIRO</b> </span>. Affinity Diagram also helped us organize the ideas about the possible solution for the users and allowed the team to observe the ideas in our study about the prototype to be built. It gave an insight on the way each researcher in the tem thought about the device, solution, and the environment as a whole. Although time consuming, we gained valuable insights on what to prioritize going forward. This method was chosen because several people combined their research before the development of the prototype.  We did the affinity mapping exercise to populate the themes and note what was important to the development of the prototype. </span></p>

														As a team, we developed a device - The Trident that fit the needs of our target audience. We interviewed participants ranging from first-time runners to seasoned marathon runners about the device built , for feedback for iterations. The feedback was collected, analyzed, coded for reference. Participants were told about  device's feature decisions based on the research conducted.

												<h2 class="header-aria">Some Insights</h2>
												<ul class="listitems">
													<li class="text-aria">The participants mentioned that if the weight is negligible while running, it would be ideal for them to dorn the device.  </li>
													<li class="text-aria"> A single sensor would not cut it in environments where wide sensing would be required.</li>
													<li class="text-aria">Participants have demonstrated that the device may not be used entirely for running. For instance, one participant voiced concern about using any device in a crowded marathon, while others mentioned the difficulty with information bombardment.</li>
													<li class="text-aria">Participants mentioned that the device could come on its own and be useful in obstacle detection given the array of sensors and the varied sensing range.</li>

												<h2 class="headingtitle"><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
												<p class="headingtitle"><span class="text-aria">From start to finish, this project has been a learning curve, and we are still on the process of refining the prototype. I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. For without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we  dealt with a niche audience, recruitment for context interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday. </span></p>
