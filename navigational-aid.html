				  <h2>Overview</h2>
				  <p class="justified"><span class = "text-aria">
				  As a research assistant at the university, I worked on this project to develop a prototype for runners who are blind. This was done in collaboration with another university and a large automobile manufacturer as part of the <b>Mobility for All</b> project. <b>TRIDENT</b> stands for Tri-Positional Detection and Navigational Technology. The key features of the system include enhanced awareness of surroundings, detection of obstacles above and below the waist, modes for long and short range detection and choice of output. These features have been determined from interviews conducted with blind joggers and runners. </p></span>

					<h3 class="header-aria">Impact</h2>
					<p class="justified"><span class = "text-aria">This <b>low cost device </b>consists of a variety of sensors to offer a wider detection range. The output works on haptics and can be used by Deaf and Hard of hearing people as well. The users do not have to spend money on devices that are expensive and bear only one sensor as this <b> prototype is a handy alternative </b>.  We anticipate that people in Low-and Middle income countries would be able to afford the device should it hit the market. This device can be used for <b> regular walking as well, extending from the runners </b>. All users liked the idea of a non-intrusive belt that can be used to detect obstacles. We have made this belt as <b> non-intrusive </b> as possible. Majority of the users feel that the belt is lightweight and can be used as an alternative to the devices currently available.</span></p>

				From initial discussions, we observed that the main problems arise when obstacles with moving obstacles and ones at head height. Often, they find it hard to concentrate on the path because of the obstacles. To alleviate some of these standing problems, our team at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County decided to build a device for blind runners through the <span class="irqhighlight"> user centered approach </span>. The project was done under the guidance of Dr.Ravi Kuber. The base requirements is that users want a device that relies on haptics and uses sensors to detect obstacles. In addition to that, the requirements point to the devices being non-invasive and portable so that it does not impeade their run in any way possible. Some of the questions that we tried to answer were : </span> </p>
				
				<h2 class="header-aria">Research Questions</h2>
					  <li class="tabspacing"><span class = "text-aria">Can the users effienciently look for the information they need after using our prototype? </span></li>

				  <h2><b>METHODOLOGY</b></h2>
				  </div>
				  
					<p class="justified">
					
					<span class = "text-aria"> Study to assess the manner in which participants interact with technology while running and develop a prototype for the same using the human-centered design process. Done in phases.</p>
					
					<h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Literature Review</b></h4>
				  
					<p class="justified"><span class = "text-aria"> The team collected several works related to prototypes for individuals who are blind. This rigorous search helped the team to understand the development from other researchers' perspectives. I populated and read through research papers to gain insight and information on the given topic, identify gaps in previous research. Overall, we wanted to have a solid background for our study. The literature study also helped provide an overview of some of the specifics used in assistive devices (Sensor information etc.,). Seeing that many researchers built prototypes as walking assistance and not running was a milestone for our project. </span></p>
				  
				  <h2 class="header-aria">Some Insights</h2>
					<ul class="listitems">
						<li class="text-aria">Research related to running is at a premium. Researhers have focussed on aiding individuals who are blind while walking from one place to another. </li>
						<li class="text-aria">Research indicates the presence of more than one kind of sensors located at different regions to tackle dynamic obstacles. </li>
						<li class="text-aria">An array of sensors is used as a feedback mechanism post obstacle detection. </li>
						<li class="text-aria">Research relates to augmenting the experiences of the white cane or building a device in conjunction with the cane. </li>
					</ul>

				  <figcaption align="center"><i>Literature Survey</i></figcaption>
				  </figure>
				  </br>
				  <h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Competitive Analysis</b></h4>
				  
					<p class="justified"><span class = "text-aria"> The team looked at some of the different products available on the market. We even ordered a couple of devices (The Buzzclip, SUNU Band) to try out and give a different opinion. The competitive analysis gave us the strengths and weaknesses of the various products used by people who suffer from vision impairments. Trying out the devices gave an understanding of the features and functions. Trying out the products also helped inform the design process. User reviews helped us understand what the users think about the different products.</span> </p>
					
					<h2 class="header-aria">Some Insights</h2>
					
					<p class="justified"><span class="text-aria">The BuzzClip is a portable device with a single sensor, but it is expensive. The BuzzClip may fall off the clip-on object and cause problems to the person using it.Other devices like the SUNU BAND have a high learnability curve and in addition to the application that comes with it. The minimum pricing is in the higher $200 range. Not many users go out of their comfort zone of using the white cane and buy specific devices.Other devices were not tried but searched online. That can be considered a drawback in the competitive analysis because the researchers do not have the first-hand experience trying out the device.

				  <h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Scenario Development</b></h4>
					<span class = "text-aria"> Multiple scenarios were developed over a period to ensure that major situations are covered and the prototype addresses them. We believe that by creating the scenarios, we could generate empathy for our user base (runners who are visually impaired) and design, and develop the most optimal solution. Scenarios also made us understand the key features of our device, where it may be used and also shed some light on the environmental condition that may hamper it's usage. We created scenarios because we believed that it would help us in understanding environmental specific motivational factors and guide user thought process.</span></p>
					<h2 class="header-aria">Some Insights</h2>
					<ul class="listitems">
						<li class="text-aria">Scenarios guided us in the design process in the sense that it allowed us to empathize with the users related to specific situations </li>
						<li class="text-aria"> Shed some light on the probable limitations of the device.</li>
						<li class="text-aria">Enabled us to identify hard-to notice user needs.</li>
						<li class="text-aria">Scenarios gave us the challenges faced by the users and how we could tackle the same.</li>
						<li class="text-aria"> Scenarios also indicated the motivations and thought processes of the users under consideration </li>

					<figcaption align="center"> <i>A sample scenario </i></figcaption>
				  </figure>
				  <h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Affinity Diagramming</b></h4>
					<p class ="justified"><span class = "text-aria"> We created the affinity diagram exercise to populate the themes, arrange thoughts from brainstorming into clusters and note what was important to the development of the prototype. Once we had all the data points ready, the team sat down and created an affinity diagram to draw themes and prioritize them. Collaboration was done on an online tool called <span class ="irqhighlight"><b>MIRO</b> </span>. Affinity Diagram also helped us organize the ideas about the possible solution for the users and allowed the team to observe the ideas in our study about the prototype to be built. It gave an insight on the way each researcher in the tem thought about the device, solution, and the environment as a whole. Although time consuming, we gained valuable insights on what to prioritize going forward. This method was chosen because several people combined their research before the development of the prototype.  We did the affinity mapping exercise to populate the themes and note what was important to the development of the prototype. </span></p>

So we interviewed participants ranging from first-time runners to seasoned marathon runners about the prospective device as a concept interview based on the research.
