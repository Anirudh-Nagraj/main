									<h3 class="uppermargin headers"><strong>What we wished to have happened...</strong></h3>
									<p class="justified paragraph">We would have liked to have gone one step further and add a camera to detect obstacles on its path and notifying the users - a field where there is a lot of research going on. We would have also liked to test the prototype in different terrains, which was impeaded due to the Global Pandemic - COVID-19.</p>


						<h3 class="uppermargin headers"><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
						<p class="justified paragraph bottompadding">
							From start to finish, this project was a learning curve. I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. Without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we dealt with a niche audience, recruitment for context interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday. I hope to take this research into the industry where I can work to develop products beneficial for people, one product at a time.
