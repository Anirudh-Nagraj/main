          Our client, the College of Engineering and Information technology (COEIT) highlighted some problems in their research website. The issues stem from the decreased usability and user reach in the website. Our team decided to employ user research and help improve the usability of the website focussing on the base requirements of increased usability and improved traffic on the website. <b>The website serves as an information hub </b> into the various dimensions, ranging from the departments, faculty to the myriad of projects. The COEIT prides itself on the excellent research that is conducted in the labs of the various departments. (For example, the Interactive Systems Research Center (ISRC)), fostering a collaborative environment. Hence, we incorporated evaluative research and helped redesign the website for better user retention and increase the average time the users spend on the website.</p>

          <p class="justified">
            <span class = "text-aria"> We showed that the proposed changes would lead to <b> greater user retention leading to more time being spent on the website </b>. Efficient navigation throughout the website leading to lesser bouncing and exiting by the users. <b> Better internal structure and content structure </b> to better aid user experience .  The efficiency of using the redesign was found to be higher than the original website (based on timed activities). The post questionnaire results show that most participants found the information displayed on the redesign easier to find and easier to read. Furthermore, the feedback button was also easier to identify in the redesign. However, there were a few negative comments about the hover feature of the redesign’s feedback button which may impact visibility. Furthermore, the color scheme implemented had mixed reviews from participants. Some liked that the redesign’s color scheme matched UMBC’s theme, others felt that the change may be too jarring for returning users. </span> </p>

We have come up with the designs so that all the concerns and pain points are taken care of. We were cautious in choosing the color of the buttons, how the pagination works on the page, and allowing the user some freedom on the reverse navigation, something that the users complained about. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see this design change being implemented as we believe that our prototype can attract a much bigger audience given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website  </p>
