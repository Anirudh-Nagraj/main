				  Our client, the College of Engineering and Information technology (COEIT) highlighted some problems in their research website. The issues stem from the decreased usability and user reach in the website. Our team decided to employ user research and help improve the usability of the website focussing on the base requirements of increased usability and improved traffic on the website. <b>The website serves as an information hub </b> into the various dimensions, ranging from the departments, faculty to the myriad of projects. The COEIT prides itself on the excellent research that is conducted in the labs of the various departments. (For example, the Interactive Systems Research Center (ISRC)), fostering a collaborative environment. Hence, we incorporated evaluative research and helped redesign the website for better user retention and increase the average time the users spend on the website. </p>

    	<p class="justified portfolio-padding">We showed that the proposed changes would lead to <b> greater user retention leading to more time being spent on the website </b>. Efficient navigation throughout the website leading to lesser bouncing and exiting by the users. <b> Better internal structure and content structure </b> to better aid user experience .  The efficiency of using the redesign was found to be higher than the original website (based on timed activities). The post questionnaire results show that most participants found the <b>information displayed on the redesign easier to find and easier to read.</b> Furthermore, the feedback button was also easier to identify in the redesign. However, there were a few negative comments about the hover feature of the redesign’s feedback button which may impact visibility. Also, the color scheme implemented had mixed reviews from participants. Some liked that the redesign’s color scheme matched UMBC’s theme, others felt that the change may be too jarring for returning users.

					</div><p class="justified">
						The user research took place over a <b>period of 16 weeks</b>, with the <b> competitive analysis done initially followed by a series of contextual inquiries, and 1-1 context interviews.</b> As this was an inhouse project, heuristic analysis was done by the researchers themselves, taking the role of the "Experts". Heuristic Evaluations were done post the interviews because we wanted to focus on one task at a time. Once we had enough data, we proceeded to create personas that encapsulate our target audience, post which, the redesign was done. Even though the client had given us the initial usability concerns, we proceeded to gain inputs from the users themselves to get a hold on the real problems faced in the website.  </span></p>

								<h2 class="uppermargin" align="center"><b>Starters - Analyzing the Competitors</b></h4>
									<p class="justified"> For the review and analysis of the website, the team performed <b>Evaluative research</b>, comprising of <b> contextual inquiries, conducted one-one interviews</b> with users to uncover specific insights based on the users' experience with the website. To come up with the redesign, we had to go in depth to understand the painpoints of the users. <b>Before that we wanted to know how the competitiors were doing.</b>



											<h4 class="textbackground uppermargin"><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h4>
											<p class="justified">
												We wanted to know what the other research websites offer. So we diverged and came up with pointers for each of them. Exploring other websites gave us the strengths and weaknesses of our client's website as opposed to others. Information was populated and insights were drawn to aid the future research for the current website.

                          <li> Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a research-oriented institution whose research section shows extensive research projects conducted by its students, as well as appropriate language used to attract their competitive recruits.</li>
                          <li>To attract customers, they use large images which stand out against the white backdrop, enhancing visibility and attention . While Carnegie Mellon University(CMU) and New York University (NYU) have research sections to showcase the centers and institutes it collaborates with, NYU has listed them in alphabetical order as well.</li>
                          <li> The University of Maryland, College Park is a local competitor, whose research section could possibly cater to students based on local factors, which the client's website could learn from. Being similar in both content and location, studying the University of Maryland College Park research section could shine some light on its usability, and highlight the key differences between them. </li>
                          <li> The University of Maryland, College Park's research section also utilizes social media well, something which the client's research section has potential for, but is yet to implement effectively.</li>

																 Heuristic evaluations were conducted on the College of Engineering and Information Technology (COEIT) research section to determine the extent of its functionality and its effect on user experience. To achieve this, we strived to identify specific issues with the website, per Nielsen’s Ten Heuristics. We converged and explored the website and evaluated the interface to find usability problems.
                                 According to the severity ratings assigned by the evaluators, issues of most importance seem to be related to unnecessary loops of navigation, redundant links, outdated images and text, lack of appropriate signifiers to accompany affordances, issues with feedback form access and submission, unclear utility, and overcrowding of information with large blocks of text.

												<h2 class="headingtitle"><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
												<p class="headingtitle"><span class="text-aria">The COEIT research website is a text-heavy website with a lot of cross-page navigation, we wanted to focus on incremental development rather than changing the setup altogether. We have come up with the designs so that all the concerns and pain points are taken care of. We were cautious in choosing the color of the buttons, how the pagination works on the page, and allowing the user some freedom on the reverse navigation, something that the users complained about. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see this design change being implemented as we believe that our prototype can attract a much bigger audience given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website   </span></p>
