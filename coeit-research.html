				<li class="paragraph justified"><b class="textbackground3"> Users and Emotions: </b>At a deeper level, other personality traits include an expressive behavior to do what they want and pursue research, and suppressing emotion when a search fails. Impatient users would cut a frustrated figure due to the loopholes in navigation,  or blame the content curators for not giving them the appropriate results. Users also express themselves as independent individuals, exploring interesting areas of research.We found that users range from being inquisitive about the content presented by the website, to being oblivious about its content due to its outdated nature.	</li>

  <h3 class="uppermargin"><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
  <p class="justified paragraph bottompadding">
  		The COEIT research website is a text-heavy website with a lot of cross-page navigation, we wanted to focus on incremental development rather than changing the setup altogether. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see these recommedations being  as we believe that it can attract a much bigger audience given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website
