             Research websites are generally verbose. So it must be said that people would like to look through the headlines and then proceed towards the website’s actual content. The COEIT research website was identified by people to be a little gaudy on the eye and have some prevailing issues that make the user shy away from the current website. Hence the attempt to redesign.

		<p class="headingtitle justified"><span class="introtext">As the COEIT research website is a text-heavy website with a lot of cross-page navigation, we wanted to focus on incremental development rather than changing the setup altogether. We have come up with the designs so that all the concerns and pain points are taken care of. We were cautious in choosing the color of the buttons, how the pagination works on the page, and allowing the user some freedom on the reverse navigation, something that the users complained about. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see this design change being implemented as we believe that our prototype <span class="irqhighlight"> <b> can attract a much bigger audience </b></span>, given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website  </span></p>
