		  The COEIT research website was identified by users to be a little gaudy on the eye and have some prevailing issues that make the user shy away from the current website. As a semester project, our client (College of Engineering and Information Technology - <b>Abbv: COEIT </b>) approached us to conduct research and provide redesigns for the research website.</p>

			<h3> About the Project</h3>
            <p class="justified text-aria">
                The website serves as an information hub into the various dimensions, ranging from the departments, faculty to the myriad of projects. The COEIT prides itself on the excellent research that is conducted in the labs of the various departments.<b> (For example, the Interactive Systems Research Center (ISRC))</b>, fostering a collaborative environment. Hence, we incorporated evaluative research and helped redesign the website for better user retention and increase the average time the users spend on the website.

		  <p class="justified text-aria"> User researcher responsible for conducting the qualitative study and help improve the usability of the existing product.  </p>
	<h3 class="header-aria"><b>Impact</b></h2>
		  <p class="justified">
			<span class = "text-aria"> We showed that the proposed changes would lead to an increase in the number of people visiting the site. Greater user retention leading to more time being spent on the website. Efficient navigation throughout the website leading to lesser bouncing and exiting by the users. Better internal structure and content structure to better aid user experience. Overall, participants seemed to enjoy using the prototype more than the original website. The efficiency of using the prototype was found to be higher than the original website (based on timed activities). The post questionnaire results show that most participants found the information displayed on the prototype easier to find and easier to read. Furthermore, the feedback button was also easier to identify in the prototype. However, there were a few negative comments about the hover feature of the prototype’s feedback button which may impact visibility. Furthermore, the color scheme implemented had mixed reviews from participants. Some liked that the prototype’s color scheme matched UMBC’s theme, others felt that the change may be too jarring for returning users. </span> </li>

          <h2><b>METHODOLOGY</b></h2>
          </div><p class="justified">
		  <p class="text-aria">We divided the project by the tasks and allotted a set number of weeks to conduct the research and design tasks.
			To come up with the redesign, we had to go in depth to understand the painpoints of the users and conduct <b>Evaluative research.</b> Starting with competitive analysis and recruiting users for contextual inquiries. </span></p></p>
		  		
		<h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Competitive Analysis</b></h4>
			
			<p class="justified"><span class="text-aria"> We wanted to know what the other research websites offer. So we diverged and came up with pointers for each of them. Exploring other websites gave us the strengths and weaknesses of our client's website as opposed to others. Information was populated and insights were drawn to aid the future research for the current website. </span> </p>
			<h2 class="header-aria">SOME INSIGHTS</h2>
				<p class="text-aria justified">Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a research-oriented institution whose research section shows extensive research projects conducted by its students, as well as appropriate language used to attract their competitive recruits. To attract customers, they use large images which stand out against the white backdrop, enhancing visibility and attention. While Carnegie Mellon University and New York University (NYU) have research sections to showcase the centers and institutes it collaborates with, <b>NYU</b> has listed them in alphabetical order as well. Finding the right balance between efficiency and visceral design could improve the current COEIT research website.The University of Maryland College Park is a local competitor, whose research section could possibly cater to students based on local factors, which the COEIT website could learn from. Being similar in both content and location, studying the UMD research section could shine some light on its usability, and highlight the key differences between them. UMD’s research section also utilizes social media well, something which the COEIT research section has potential for, but is yet to implement effectively.</p>
			<img src="assets/img/Personal/CA2.png" class="avatar9" alt="">
			
			<h4 class="uppermargin"><b>Contextual Inquiries </b></h4>
			<p class="justified"> <span class = "text-aria"> Two participants were recruited and observed in their natural element. Insights were drawn from the user inputs when  thinking aloud while operating on the website. We wanted to conduct contextual inquiries because we wanted to find out some answers to the some of the functions by letting users talk about what they are doing and why when they are doing it. Detailed information is not obtained from contextual inquiries, so we decided to keep this as a precursor for the interview sessions because we would have a general idea on how to go about the questions.</span> </p>	
			  <h2 class="header-aria">SOME INSIGHTS</h2>
				<p class="text-aria justified"><b>Participant P1 </b> was, for the most part, satisfied with her experience. She enjoyed the visual content via images and videos. She also felt that there is a lot of impressive written content on the website. However, there were a few elements which caused confusion and frustration.</p>

				<p class="text-aria justified"><b> Participant P2 </b>, has prior experience of using the website. She did note some differences from the last time but was not put off by a myriad of changes. She was satisfied with the overall experience of the website. She was particularly impressed by the positioning and the usages of images along with the text to draw attention.  In addition to these, there are instances where she felt like there is information overload.

			  <blockquote> <i>I think this button is a little weird, it’s on like every page Did you find what you were looking for today? It looks like a button but it is actually a link in a box. That's kinda weird. I don’t want to go there, it scares me.</i></blockquote>

To achieve this, we strived to identify specific issues with the website, per Nielsen’s Ten Heuristics. We converged and explored the website and evaluated the interface to find usability problems. These problems were recorded in the form of a written report using <b>Usability Aspect Reports (UARs)</b>.</span> </p>
			
			
			<h2 class="header-aria">SOME INSIGHTS</h2>
			<p class="text-aria justified">
			According to the severity ratings assigned by the evaluators, issues of most importance seem to be related to unnecessary loops of navigation, redundant links, outdated images and text, lack of appropriate signifiers to accompany affordances, issues with feedback form access and submission, unclear utility, and overcrowding of information with large blocks of text.

			Most of these issues were rated fairly easy to fix. Some exceptions of difficult solutions involve changes related to user actions (such as on-hover), relocating utilities, and restructuring textual content to reduce information overload. </p>

					
			 
			<h4 class="uppermargin"><b>User Interviews </b></h4>
			<p class="justified"> <span class= "text-aria"> Three participants were asked to participate in a full interview that was semi-structured.  Specific inputs from the participants enabled us to strengthen the findings and combine the insights obtained from the contextual inquiries. </span> </p>	
			
			  <blockquote> <i>Maybe when you click on Research, this should be the first thing that pops up. This is what UMBC does. This is far more interesting. Every website says that they do cross-disciplinary research. But it is nice to see examples of it, like they do here with this. But they currently have this at the second to last last item in their menu. So....</i></blockquote>

		<p class="text-aria justified">As the COEIT research website is a text-heavy website with a lot of cross-page navigation, we wanted to focus on incremental development rather than changing the setup altogether. We have come up with the designs so that all the concerns and pain points are taken care of. We were cautious in choosing the color of the buttons, how the pagination works on the page, and allowing the user some freedom on the reverse navigation, something that the users complained about. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see this design change being implemented as we believe that our prototype can attract a much bigger audience given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website  </p>
