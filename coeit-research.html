			<h3> About the Project</h3>
            <p class="justified">
              Research websites are generally verbose. So it must be said that people would like to look through the headlines and then proceed towards the website’s actual content. The COEIT research website was identified by users to be a little gaudy on the eye and have some prevailing issues that make the user shy away from the current website. Hence, we incorporated evaluative research and helped redesign the website for better user retention and increase the average time the users spend on the website.

		  <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p class="justified text-aria">
				Through the insights derived from the qualitative study, we improved the overall usability of the website via the redesigns, mapped the users mental models with those of the conceptual models, and projected an increase in the number of people visiting the website.

Every website says that they do cross-disciplinary research. But it is nice to see examples of it, like they do here with this. But they currently have this at the second to last last item in their menu. So....</i></blockquote>

          <h2><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
		<p class="text-aria justified">As the COEIT research website is a text-heavy website with a lot of cross-page navigation, we wanted to focus on incremental development rather than changing the setup altogether. We have come up with the designs so that all the concerns and pain points are taken care of. We were cautious in choosing the color of the buttons, how the pagination works on the page, and allowing the user some freedom on the reverse navigation, something that the users complained about. Additionally, this was an enjoyable experience as it involved a lot of user research and data synthesis. I got a teammate who helped me grow as the project wore on. In the future, we would like to see this design change being implemented as we believe that our prototype can attract a much bigger audience given our exhaustive and extensive work to refine the existing website  </p>
