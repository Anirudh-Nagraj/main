		  According to the WHO website, globally, it is estimated that at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. The number of individuals who are blind, using technology to assist them, are relatively few in numbers as compared to the total number. These technologies include mobile applications, smart walking sticks, voice assistants, and so on., This project looks at developing a mobile navigation application for individuals who are blind.

			<h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p class="justified text-aria">
               As a diversion from my thesis, I decided to do a personal project to come up with an application for individuals who are blind when it comes to navigation and aid them in navigating from one place to another.

			<h3 class="header-aria">Impact</h2>
		  	<p class = "text-aria justified">Many individuals who suffer from vision loss will be helped with the application irrespective of the demographic. Increased interactions because of the continuous volunteering of sighted people. This would lead to greater usage of the application and greater awareness among people. An application that can be a proper substitute in the market for the solitary applications like AIRA/Be My Eyes. More individuals who are blind, connected to technology. Ease of Access because of prior interactions with voice assistants. </p>.

            <span class = "text-aria"> This is an individual project driven by my motivation to help individuals who are blind. As a part of my thesis, I am investigating the navigational habits of individuals who are blind. From the semi-structured interviews, I decided to use that data, along with other user research techniques to come up with an application that may encapsulates things that users would like to see in a navigational application. Currently the functionalities are spread out across applications which leads me to wonder, can I make an application prototype that puts all the navigation functionalities in one application?. </span> </p>

		<p class="text-aria justified">I am extremely mindful to employ progressive disclosure. Given that we are dealing with individuals who are blind, we really cannot push too much information on a single screen. The content has to be relatively easy to identify and understand. Progressive Disclosure would allow me to push all the information that was not necessary to screens at the back that would only appear when needed.

		<p class="text-aria justified"><span class="text-aria">From trying to empathize with the blind community to putting all my might behind making a prototype that is accessible to them, I have come a long way. I feel that the project has made me a stronger person mentally. I was skeptical at the beginning of the project, but as time progressed, the belief instilled in me by the community made me realize how we are gifted to have everything at our disposal and use it with so much ease. Along the way, I faced innumerable challenges. Everyone I spoke to had an opinion and a design idea. I went with my instincts, tried being in the shoes of a blind person, empathizing with them. This helped me understand and develop a novel idea for the application. I went with the idea that connecting people on the app is similar to what happens in rideshare, and I hope that one day, even if my prototype does not hit the market, it stands as an inspiration for many designs to come.  </span></p>
