				According to the WHO website, globally, it is estimated that at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or issues that are unaddressed. The number of individuals who are blind, using technology to assist them, is relatively few in number compared to the total number. These technologies include mobile applications, smart walking sticks, voice assistants, and so on.,
				<b>This is project driven by my motivation to help individuals who are in need of assistance.</b><b> Currently the functionalities are spread out across applications which leads me to wonder, can I make an application prototype that puts all the navigation functionalities in one application? </b>

An application that can be a <b> proper substitute in the market </b> for the solitary specialized applications that exist in the market today.This may lead to more individuals who are blind being connected to technology. Ease of Access because of prior interactions with voice assistants. <b>Intended to perform the simplest of the functions in the the most efficient way possible. </b> </p>

											To populate the insights and draw major themes arising from the research and the profiling, we decided to create an affinity map.

Parallely, the team also started coding the data for the interviews conducted to populate the insights and base the design accordingly.

											<h4 class="textbackground uppermargin"><b>Storyboards</b></h4>

													<p class="justified">

													I created <b>early research storyboards</b> to envision the finished application in terms of a real world setting. Turns out, the storyboards were <b>very short, sequence-orientated, and fit the overall narrative well. </b>
													 I aimed to envision the finished research project - how the mobile application would function in a real life scenario. Storyboards changed my perception of the functionalities that can be implemented in my project. I realized that my application cannot have all the functionalities that I desire because of constraints indicated by the storyboards. The storyboards helped me synthesize the content and match my thinking with the constraints.

I realized that empathy generation is key because of the type of audience involved. In addition to that, I also learned to employ the human aspect in research. For without connection and interaction with people, I believe that nothing is possible. Figuring out the research techniques and drawing the right insights is a challenge in itself. Additionally, as we  dealt with a niche audience, recruitment for context interviews and observation was also a challenge. Here is hoping that this prototype becomes a product someday. </span></p>
